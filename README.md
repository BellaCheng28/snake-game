- [ ] Snake Game


## Project Description 

My app is called snake game. It's a game app for players who want to play snake games online. It is a timeless arcade-style game where players control a growing snake that must navigate a grid,eat food to increase its length.and avoid colliding with walls or its own tail.The objective is to score as high as possible while managing the increasing difficulty as the snake grows.
